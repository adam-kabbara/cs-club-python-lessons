# in order to create a variable, you need to come up with a variable name first
# variable names can contain numbers but should always start with a letter
# and NO spaces are allowed in variable names, use underscores instead

greeting = "hello!"
# so now, when we type greeting anywhere in the code, it is going to refer back to "hello!"
print(greeting)

# variables can also be assigned to different data types
age = 21
able_to_fly = False
print(age)
print(able_to_fly)

# variables can also be reused and overwritten
# lets say that today is the bday of the person who is age years old
# so now we need to increment his age by one
age = age + 1
print(age)

# we can also completly change the data type of a variable 
# so now instad of point to an int, age points to a string
age = "undefined"
